# PDS Review and Standardization Project

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive review and standardization project conducted on the PDS microservices system. The project aimed to ensure consistency, completeness, and correctness across all services, documentation, and code.

## Review Scope

The review covered all aspects of the PDS microservices system, including:

1. **Code and Configuration**
   - Service implementations
   - Docker configurations
   - Environment variables
   - API definitions

2. **Documentation**
   - Implementation guides
   - API specifications
   - Architecture documents
   - README files

3. **Standards and Patterns**
   - Error handling
   - Data models
   - Authentication/authorization
   - UI implementation
   - Security practices

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Terminology Standardization

We identified and resolved terminology inconsistencies across the codebase:

- Renamed "Test VC Creator" to "DRO" (Departmental Records Office) consistently
- Renamed "MERN App" to "FEP" (Frontend Portal) consistently
- Updated all references in documentation, code, and configuration

### 2. Comprehensive Service Documentation

Created detailed README-IMPLEMENTATION.md files for each service:

- **API Registry**: Enhanced with API key management documentation
- **Solid PDS**: Added WebID profile details and authentication flows
- **DRO**: Updated credential issuance documentation
- **VC Verifier**: Enhanced verification process documentation
- **FEP**: Added UI standards and integration details

### 3. Standardization Documents

Created system-wide standardization documents:

- **ERROR_HANDLING_STANDARDS.md**: Defines common error format and codes
- **DATA_MODELS.md**: Establishes consistent data models
- **GOVUK_DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md**: UI implementation guidelines

### 4. Security Enhancements

Improved security practices across the system:

- Replaced hardcoded API keys with environment variables
- Added detailed API key management
- Implemented proper secret management
- Added security requirements to service documentation

### 5. Docker Configuration Improvements

Enhanced docker-compose.yml with:

- Environment variable support
- Health checks
- MongoDB configuration
- Restart policies
- Improved networking

### 6. Implementation Checklist

Created a comprehensive checklist for verifying service implementations:

- Documentation requirements
- Standardization compliance
- Security practices
- Testing requirements
- Code quality standards
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and observability

## Impact of Changes
