# React UI Service Specification

## Overview

The React UI Service provides a user interface for interacting with the Solid PDS, managing Verifiable Credentials, and authenticating with WebID. It serves as the primary interface for end users to register, login, and manage their data and credentials.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Register a new user in the Solid PDS
- **WebID Authentication**: Login using WebID-based authentication
- **Pod Management**: Create and manage Solid Pods
- **Credential Management**: Request, view, and manage Verifiable Credentials
- **Credential Verification**: Verify credentials and view verification results
- **Profile Management**: View and edit user profile information

## UI Components

### Authentication

- **Registration Form**: Form for creating a new user account
- **Login Form**: Form for logging in with WebID
- **Authentication Status**: Display of current authentication status

### Pod Management

- **Pod Creation**: Interface for creating a new pod
- **Pod Explorer**: Browser for viewing and managing pod contents
- **Access Control**: Interface for managing access to pod resources

### Credential Management

- **Credential Request**: Interface for requesting new credentials
- **Credential List**: Display of all user credentials
- **Credential Detail**: Detailed view of a specific credential
- **Credential Verification**: Interface for verifying credentials

## Implementation Details

The React UI is implemented as a React application using modern React patterns and libraries. It uses the Inrupt Solid Client libraries to interact with the Solid PDS.

### Technology Stack

- React
- React Router for navigation
- Redux or Context API for state management
- @inrupt/solid-client for Solid interactions
- @inrupt/solid-ui-react for Solid UI components
- Material-UI or similar for UI components

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow follows the Solid OIDC specification:

1. User clicks Login and is redirected to the Solid Identity Provider
2. User authenticates with the Identity Provider
3. User is redirected back to the application with an authorization code
4. Application exchanges the code for an access token
5. Application uses the access token to access protected resources

## Deployment

The React UI is deployed as a Docker container. It serves the React application on port 3004 and communicates with the backend services.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- React
- @inrupt/solid-client
- @inrupt/solid-ui-react

## Integration Points

The React UI interacts with the following services:

- **Solid PDS**: For user authentication, pod management, and data storage
- **Test VC Creator**: For requesting and storing test credentials
- **VC Verifier**: For verifying credentials
- **DID Registry**: For managing DIDs (indirectly via other services)
